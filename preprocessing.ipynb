Each data-set contains information about several patent grants, e.g., patent title, patent ID, citation network, abstract etc. The task is to extract the data and transform the data into the CSV and JSON format with the following elements:\n",
    "1. grant_id: a unique ID for a patent grant consisting of alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "2. patent_kind: a category to which the patent grant belongs.\n",

Discussion of Related Art</heading><p id=\"p-0003\" num=\"0002\">Applications increasingly consume services via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in cloud-provided runtimes. A cloud-provided runtime is a category of cloud computing service that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an application.</p><p id=\"p-0004\" num=\"0003\">A server-side web API is a programmatic interface consisting of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined request-response message system, typically expressed in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or Extensible Markup Language (XML) and exposed via the web by means of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP-based) web server. Endpoints specify where resources lie that than be accessed by third party software. Usually the access is via a Universal Resource Locator (URL) to which HTTP requests are posed, and from which a corresponding response is expected.</p><p id=\"p-0005\" num=\"0004\">However, since there are thousands of different web APIs available and different versions of each, it is difficult for a device running an automated test process or a user such as a developer to pick the right web API.</p><heading id=\"h-0004\" level=\"1\">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id=\"p-0006\" num=\"0005\">A computer-implemented method according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention is provided for recommending a web application programming interface (API).

Throughout the drawings, same or like reference numerals are used to represent the same or like components. However, the present inventive concept can be implemented in various manners, and thus should not be construed to be limited to the embodiments disclosed herein. On the contrary, those embodiments are provided for the thorough and complete understanding of the present disclosure to convey the scope of the present disclosure to those skilled in the art.</p><p id=\"p-0019\" num=\"0018\">It is understood in advance that although this disclosure includes a detailed description on cloud computing, implementation of the teachings recited herein are not limited to a cloud computing environment. Rather, embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed. Examples are the orchestration of a manufacturing process, a process to retrieve or store goods in a wholesale or retail store, a process to analyze a medical sample or set of samples, a process governing a series of chemical reactions, a process to analyze and file incoming paper documents in a financial institution, a process to manufacture a chemical substance, a process to monitor an automobile engine, a process to monitor a chemical reaction, or a process to monitor a medical device.</p><p id=\"p-0020\" num=\"0019\">Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics, at least three service models, and at least four deployment models.</p><p id=\"p-0021\" num=\"0020\">Characteristics are as follows:</p><p id=\"p-0022\" num=\"0021\">On-demand self-service: a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service\\'s provider. Broad network access: capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).</p><p id=\"p-0023\" num=\"0022\">Resource pooling: the provider\\'s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).</p><p id=\"p-0024\" num=\"0023\">Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.</p><p id=\"p-0025\" num=\"0024\">Measured service: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.</p><p id=\"p-0026\" num=\"0025\">Service Models are as follows:</p><p id=\"p-0027\" num=\"0026\">Software as a Service (SaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider\\'s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based e-mail). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.</p><p id=\"p-0028\" num=\"0027\">Platform as a Service (PaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.</p><p id=\"p-0029\" num=\"0028\">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).</p><p id=\"p-0030\" num=\"0029\">Deployment Models are as follows:</p><p id=\"p-0031\" num=\"0030\">Private cloud: the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.</p><p id=\"p-0032\" num=\"0031\">Community cloud: the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.</p><p id=\"p-0033\" num=\"0032\">Public cloud: the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.</p><p id=\"p-0034\" num=\"0033\">Hybrid cloud: the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds). A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability. At the heart of cloud computing is an infrastructure comprising a network of interconnected nodes. Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, illustrative cloud computing environment <b>50</b> is depicted. As shown, cloud computing environment <b>50</b> comprises one or more cloud computing nodes <b>10</b> with which local computing devices used by cloud consumers, such as, for example, personal digital assistant (PDA) or cellular telephone <b>54</b>A, desktop computer <b>54</b>B, laptop computer <b>54</b>C, and/or automobile computer system <b>54</b>N may communicate. Nodes <b>10</b> may communicate with one another. They may be grouped (not shown) physically or virtually, in one or more networks, such as Private, Community, Public, or Hybrid clouds as described hereinabove, or a combination thereof. This allows cloud computing environment <b>50</b> to offer infrastructure, platforms and/or software as services for which a cloud consumer does not need to maintain resources on a local computing device. It is understood that the types of computing devices <b>54</b>A-N shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref> are intended to be illustrative only and that computing nodes <b>10</b> and cloud computing environment <b>50</b> can communicate with any type of computerized device over any type of network and/or network addressable connection (e.g., using a web browser).</p><p id=\"p-0035\" num=\"0034\">Referring now to <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, a set of functional abstraction layers provided by cloud computing environment <b>50</b> (<figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>) is shown. It should be understood in advance that the components, layers, and functions shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref> are intended to be illustrative only and embodiments of the invention are not limited thereto.

Examples of workloads and functions which may be provided from this layer include: mapping and navigation <b>91</b>; software development and lifecycle management <b>92</b>; virtual classroom education delivery <b>93</b>; data analytics processing <b>94</b>; transaction processing <b>95</b>; and a web API recommendation engine <b>96</b>, which will be discussed in more detail below.</p><p id=\"p-0040\" num=\"0039\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a computer system/server <b>12</b> that may be used to implement part of computing devices <b>54</b>A-<b>54</b>N of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 1</figref>, or the web API recommendation engine <b>96</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 2</figref>, which is applicable to implementing embodiments of the present invention. The computer system/server <b>12</b> is only illustrative and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of embodiments of the invention described herein.</p><p id=\"p-0041\" num=\"0040\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 3</figref>, the computer system/server <b>12</b> is shown in the form of a general-purpose computing device. The components of the computer system/server <b>12</b> may include, but are not limited to, one or more processors or processing units <b>16</b>, a system memory <b>28</b>, and a bus <b>18</b> that couples various system components including system memory <b>28</b> to processor <b>16</b>.</p><p id=\"p-0042\" num=\"0041\">Bus <b>18</b> represents one or more of any of several types of bus structures, including a memory bus or memory controller, a peripheral bus, an accelerated graphics port, and a processor or local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. By way of example, and not limitation, such architectures include an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a Micro Channel Architecture (MCA) bus, an Enhanced ISA (EISA) bus, a Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) local bus, and a Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) bus.</p><p id=\"p-0043\" num=\"0042\">The computer system/server <b>12</b> may include a variety of computer system readable media. Such media may be any available media that is accessible by the computer system/server <b>12</b>, and it includes both volatile and non-volatile media, removable and non-removable media.</p><p id=\"p-0044\" num=\"0043\">The system memory <b>28</b> can include computer system readable media in the form of volatile memory, such as random access memory (RAM) <b>30</b> and/or cache memory <b>32</b>.

Each of the operating system, one or more application programs, other program modules, and program data or some combination thereof, may include an implementation of a networking environment. The program modules <b>42</b> generally carry out the functions and/or methodologies of embodiments of the invention as described herein.</p><p id=\"p-0046\" num=\"0045\">The computer system/server <b>12</b> may also communicate with one or more external devices <b>14</b> such as a keyboard, a pointing device, a display <b>24</b>, etc.; one or more devices that enable a user to interact with the computer system/server <b>12</b>; and/or any devices (e.g., network card, modem, etc.) that enable the computer system/server <b>12</b> to communicate with one or more other computing devices. Such communication can occur via Input/Output (I/O) interfaces <b>22</b>. The computer system/server <b>12</b> can communicate with one or more networks such as a local area network (LAN), a general wide area network (WAN), and/or a public network (e.g., the Internet) via a network adapter <b>20</b>.

The static information may be generated by analyzing application source code (applications or user-provided actions) of a developer to learn which APIs and endpoints are currently being used and how these APIs are being used (e.g., what parameters are used, what data is returned, etc.). The dynamic information may be determined from monitoring requests (e.g., HTTP requests) at runtime and analyzing runtime logs. For example, the dynamic information may include quality of service (QoS) information.</p><p id=\"p-0048\" num=\"0047\">The web API recommendation engine <b>96</b> has access to application source code and monitoring data about dynamic API requests. A Cloud-provided runtime (e.g., a cloud platform as a service) like CLOUD FOUNDRY or OPENWHISK provides access to the application code in contrast to virtual machines or containers.</p><p id=\"p-0049\" num=\"0048\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a method of operating the web API recommendation engine <b>96</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventive concept. The method includes reading source code that invokes at least one web API (S<b>101</b>). The source code may include at least one serverless action.</p><p id=\"p-0050\" num=\"0049\">In an embodiment, a developer is running the client of a cloud-provided runtime on their computer, and the client presents a graphical user interface (GUI) on a display of the computer that enables the developer to send test code to the cloud-provided runtime. For example, the GUI could enable the developer to select a file on their computer for upload across the Internet to a server housing the cloud-provided runtime. In an embodiment, the GUI runs a program to test whether the file includes sufficient test code, and if the test determines the test code is not sufficient, the GUI provides an error message to the developer. In an embodiment, the test code is sufficient when it includes at least one web API request.</p><p id=\"p-0051\" num=\"0050\">In an embodiment, the GUI packages the test code in a payload of a message with a header that indicates the payload contains test code to be used in providing a web API recommendation. The cloud-provided runtime can recognize the received message includes the test code from reading the header, and then reads the test code. For example, the read may include the cloud-provided runtime executing an open function on the received test code.</p><p id=\"p-0052\" num=\"0051\">The method further includes extracting one or more web API request(s) from the source code (S<b>102</b>). In an embodiment, each web API request is located in a function such as a Web action. For example, the Web action could be written as a JavaScript action. In an embodiment, the web API request includes an HTTP request having a web address known as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The HTTP request includes text indicating that it is an HTTP request such as &#x201c;https:&#x201d; and text of an URL. The URL may include a web address of a web server and directory information indicating the location of a function on the webserver that responds to the request. The directory information may also indicate the version of the function. The HTTP request may include one or more parameters. For example, if the HTTP request is for weather data, the URL could be the web address of a server that stores a function capable of providing weather data and the parameters could indicate the city for which the weather data is to be retrieved.</p><p id=\"p-0053\" num=\"0052\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an example of test code <b>200</b> that can be operated on by the cloud-provided runtime to perform the web API recommendation. The test code <b>200</b> includes a web action <b>211</b>, which includes a first web API request <b>212</b> and a second web API request <b>213</b>. In an embodiment, extraction code of the cloud-provided runtime determines it has found a web action when its parsing of the test code <b>200</b> returns a first token having text of &#x2018;function&#x2019; spaced apart from a second token having text indicating the name of the function (e.g., see function name &#x2018;getLogURL&#x2019; of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>). The second token may include one or more parameters. In the example shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the function receives a parameter entitled &#x2018;jobID&#x2019;. The extraction code may exit if it is not able to find a web action.</p><p id=\"p-0054\" num=\"0053\">If the extraction code is able to find a web action, it continues to parse the test code <b>200</b>. If the continued parsing returns a third token having text indicating a variable (e.g., &#x2018;var&#x2019;), a fourth token having text indicating a name of the variable, and a fifth token having text indicating an URL (e.g., &#x2018;https:xxx&#x2019;), the extraction code extracts the URL and associates the extracted URL with the variable. For example, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the extraction code would extract a first URL of &#x201c;https:api.travis-ci.org/hobs/&#x201d; and associate it with a first variable &#x2018;c1&#x2019;. If there are additional tokens after the extracted URL, the extraction code may consider these to be first parameters, and associate these first parameters with the first variable. For example, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the first parameters would include &#x2018;jobID&#x2019; and &#x2018;log.txt?deansi=true&#x2019;.</p><p id=\"p-0055\" num=\"0054\">The extraction code may continue parsing the test code <b>200</b> for additional variables. For example, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the extraction code would next extract a second URL of &#x201c;https:s3.amaxonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs&#x201d; and second parameters of &#x2018;jobID&#x2019; and &#x2018;/log.text&#x2019; and associate them with a second variable &#x2018;c2&#x2019;.</p><p id=\"p-0056\" num=\"0055\">While the test code <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref> includes several variables, the test code <b>200</b> need not contain any variables. Further, if an extracted variable does not include an URL, it can be ignored.</p><p id=\"p-0057\" num=\"0056\">The parsing continues until zero or more web API requests are found. If no web API requests, the extraction code may exit with an error code indicating the test code <b>200</b> is not sufficient for performing a recommendation. The extraction code may determine that a web API request is present when it encounters a token having text that is indicative of a request such as &#x2018;request&#x2019;. Upon encountering this token, the extraction code knows that a web API request is potentially present. The extraction code may determine that the web API request is present when the next token is the same as one of the prior extracted variables that includes an URL or it includes an URL. For example, as shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>, the extraction code determines that a first web API request <b>212</b> is present since a token after the token having text &#x2018;request&#x2019; is the same as a previously extracted variable &#x2018;c1&#x2019; having an URL, and determines that a second web API request <b>213</b> is present since a token after the second token having text &#x2018;request&#x2019; is the same as previously extracted variable &#x2018;c2&#x2019; also including an URL. The extraction code may determine whether the request is an HTTP post if it encounters a token such as request.post or it encounters a token specifying the method type such as &#x2018;method:POST&#x2019; after a token named &#x2018;request&#x2019;.</p><p id=\"p-0058\" num=\"0057\">In an embodiment, the extraction code generates code in a JSON format based on the web API requests determined from the test code <b>200</b> that includes information about the web API requests. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 6</figref> shown an example of code <b>300</b> in a JSON format that corresponds to the web API requests extracted from the test code <b>200</b> of <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 5</figref>. In this example, the JSON code <b>300</b> includes a tag (e.g., &#x201c;requests&#x201d;:) indicating that web API requests are present, and a listing including text associated with each of the web API requests. For example, each item in the listing may include a first tag (e.g., &#x201c;url&#x201d;:) indicating that that an URL is present, a second tag (e.g., &#x201c;method&#x201d;:) indicating that a HTTP method is present in the request, and a third tag (e.g., &#x201c;parameters&#x201d;:) indicating that parameters to be passed to the request are present. For example, text after the first tag may indicate the URL, text after the second tag may indicate the type of method (e.g., &#x201c;get&#x201d;, &#x201c;post&#x201d;, etc.), and text after the third tag may indicate the actual parameters that are to be passed to the web API request. If the second tag is not present the extraction code may assume that an HTTP GET is present in the request.</p><p id=\"p-0059\" num=\"0058\">The method further includes logging a dynamic trace of the extracted web API requests (S<b>103</b>). The cloud-provided runtime may have previously logged use of various web APIs by various application, which may include the web API associated with the extracted web API requests. So this logging may have started before the web API requests were extracted from the test code. If the cloud-provided runtime is not currently logging use of web APIs or is not currently logging use of web APIs associated with the extracted web API requests, the cloud-provided runtime can configure a logging routine to begin logging these events.</p><p id=\"p-0060\" num=\"0059\"><figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a log file <b>400</b> generated by the logging that includes request information <b>410</b> and response information <b>420</b>. The request information <b>410</b> may include information (e.g., &#x2018;REQ&#x2019;) indicating it is request information so it can be differentiated from the response information <b>420</b>. The response information <b>420</b> may include information (e.g., &#x2018;RES&#x2019;) indicating it is response information so it can be differentiated from the request information <b>420</b>. In an embodiment, the response information <b>420</b> that includes information received in response a request and is located on the next line after the request information <b>410</b> associated with the request.</p><p id=\"p-0061\" num=\"0060\">The request information <b>410</b> may include information indicating the internet protocol (IP) address of the computer that is to respond to the web API request and the corresponding response information <b>420</b> may include the IP address of the computer that responded to the web API request.</p><p id=\"p-0062\" num=\"0061\">The request information <b>410</b> may further include a time when the web API request was initiated (request time) and the corresponding response information <b>420</b> may include a time when the response to the web API request was received by the party that issued the request (e.g., response time). The cloud-provided runtime can determine latency of the web API request by subtracting the response time from the request time. The request information <b>410</b> may further include the date when the web API request was initiated and the corresponding response information <b>420</b> may include the date when the response to the web API request was received by the party that issued the request. The dates may be used along with the times to determine the latency.</p><p id=\"p-0063\" num=\"0062\">The request information <b>410</b> may include text indicating the type of HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST, etc.) that was initiated by the party and the corresponding response information may include text indicating the type of the HTTP request being responded to.</p><p id=\"p-0064\" num=\"0063\">The request information <b>410</b> and the response information <b>410</b> may include the URL associated with the computer that is responding to the request.</p><p id=\"p-0065\" num=\"0064\">The response information <b>420</b> may additionally include status information <b>430</b> (e.g., a status code), which indicates whether or not the request was successful or failed. For example, the status information <b>430</b> may be a first value to indicate a success and a second other value to indicate a failure.</p><p id=\"p-0066\" num=\"0065\">The method further includes creating a recommendation that indicates one web API among a plurality of web APIs (S<b>104</b>). For example, if the test code <b>200</b> includes a first web API and has a first quality below a certain quality threshold, the recommendation identifies a second web API having a second quality higher than the first quality or higher than the quality threshold. The creating of the recommendation may include aggregating the logs, deriving at least one quality of service (QoS) from the aggregated logs, and generating the recommendation from each derived QoS. For example, the cloud-provided runtime can obtain metrics on the responsiveness and/or the error rate of a given web API by analyzing the log files, to determine which web API to recommend.</p><p id=\"p-0067\" num=\"0066\">For example, the average response time for a given web API may be calculated by summing the calculated latencies for the given web API and dividing the result by the number of logged requests to the given web API. For example, a counter can be incremented each time a request to a given web API is responded to successfully to generate a count, and that count can be divided by the total number of requests to the given web API including the ones that failed to calculate the error rate of the web API. The cloud-provided runtime can exclude the requests that failed from the calculation of the response time.</p><p id=\"p-0068\" num=\"0067\">As shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>, when a serverless platform such as the cloud-provided runtime executes a web action, an object (e.g., see web Activation <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, . . . , N) is instantiated to perform the web action. <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> shows a series of interrelated web actions that call one another, where the second Activation (i.e., Activation <b>2</b>) associated with the second web action generates data <b>500</b> including information about the second web action and what triggered it. In an embodiment, the data <b>500</b> is in a JSON format. For example, the data <b>500</b> may include information on the duration of the web action, a name identifier of the web action (e.g., &#x201c;apih-oai-compose&#x201d;) being executed, a name identifier (e.g., &#x201c;aafd132j . . . &#x201d;) of the web action (e.g., the first web section) that caused the web action (e.g., the second web action) to be executed, a version of the web action (e.g., &#x201c;version&#x201d;), and the data that was sent to the web action (e.g., &#x201c;value&#x201d;). For example, the &#x201c;value&#x201d; shown in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref> may represent the data passed from the first web action (e.g., Action <b>1</b>) to the second web action when the first web action called the second web action. The cloud-provided runtime may access the data <b>500</b> using a call to the web activation (e.g., Activation <b>2</b>).</p><p id=\"p-0069\" num=\"0068\">The creation of the recommendation may include analyzing the log files (e.g., see <b>400</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 7</figref>) and the data maintained by the web activations (e.g., see <b>500</b> in <figref idref=\"DRAWINGS\">FIG. 8</figref>) to determine a base URL, an URL path of the base URL, and the data passed to the web actions. The web API can be identified from the base URL. An endpoint (e.g., a web service endpoint) can be identified from the URL path. The endpoint is a web address at which clients of a specific service can gain access to the service.</p><p id=\"p-0070\" num=\"0069\">Each request information <b>410</b> and corresponding response information <b>420</b> may be grouped together into a tuple. The tuples may then be grouped based on a particular policy. For example, tuples having calls to the same web API (e.g., same base URL) may be grouped together. Other groupings can be made based on API functions or categories, API provides, API cost, etc. Tuples relevant to the current timeframe (e.g., last week, last month) may be selected for analysis. The resulting tuples may be analyzed to determine how often server/user errors occurs, the size the requests, and the size of the responses. For example, if errors are common (e.g., errors occurs in &#x3e;30% of the requests) when using a first web API among several web APIs that are used retrieve weather data, the cloud-provided runtime can select another one of the web APIs where errors are rarely encountered (e.g., errors occur in &#x3c;5% of the requests). The cloud-provided runtime may consider more than one factor when making a recommendation. In an embodiment, the cloud-provided runtime considers the percent of requests that succeed, the duration of the requests, and the current timeframe. For example, the cloud-provided runtime could recommend a web API where 95% of the requests have succeeded in less than 200 ms in the last hour. Resampling, moving averages, and least square methods may be applied to the data of the tuples to eliminate random noise.</p><p id=\"p-0071\" num=\"0070\">The method further includes sending the recommendation to the developer (S<b>105</b>). The cloud-provided runtime can provide the recommendation to the developer while the developer is writing their code. For example, the code editor of the client of the cloud-provided runtime that the developer is using to write their code may display a popup menu suggesting a different API after the user types in part or all of a name of a web API that is capable of performing the same function. For example, if the user types the name of a web API into the client that is typically used to retrieve weather data, and the cloud-runtime has discovered a better one, the cloud-runtime can cause a message to popup on a display of the developer through the client informing the developer of the better web API. The popup may indicate reasons why the recommended web API is better and offer to auto-replace the previously entered web API with the recommended web API.</p><p id=\"p-0072\" num=\"0071\">The cloud-provided runtime may consider the endpoints used when making a web API recommendation. For example, if the endpoint of a first web API has better latency than the endpoint of a second web API, the cloud-runtime could recommend the second web API.</p><p id=\"p-0073\" num=\"0072\">The cloud-runtime may consider the geographic location of the server deploying the web actions. For example, even though the same type of web API is deployed in country A and country B, it is possible that the web API is maintained better in country B. For example, if the cloud-provided runtime determines that the same web API has the highest quality in country A, it could recommend the web API with an endpoint that is associated with country A.</p><p id=\"p-0074\" num=\"0073\">The cloud-provided runtime may recommend a web API from information it has collected from multiple other developers. For example, if the cloud-provided runtime determines that 90% of developers use a given web API to support the same functions implemented by a current developer, the cloud-provided runtime can recommend that web API to the current developer.</p><p id=\"p-0075\" num=\"0074\">The cloud-provided runtime may consider expected availability of several web APIs in determining which of the web APIs to recommend. In an embodiment, the expected availability is the ratio of requests that succeed verses the ones that fail. For example, the logs may shows that many web API requests were cancelled due to a timeout error, which indicates the API could not be reached (i.e., has a diminishing availability).</p><p id=\"p-0076\" num=\"0075\">The cloud-provided runtime may consider the parameters the developer is using with a given web API to determine whether to recommend a different web API. For example, if the test code being analyzed uses a first web API with a particular parameter known to severely increase the latency of the first web API, and the cloud-provided runtime has observed that a second web API using the same parameter has a much smaller increase in latency, the cloud-provided runtime can recommend the second web API.</p><p id=\"p-0077\" num=\"0076\">The recommended API can be provided through an integrated development environment (IDE) that includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger that the developer accesses through a single graphical user interface. The recommended API can also be provided within a cloud-based editor.</p><p id=\"p-0078\" num=\"0077\">The present invention may be a system, a method, and/or a computer program product. The computer program product may include a computer readable storage medium (or media) having computer readable program instructions thereon for causing a processor to carry out aspects of the present invention.</p><p id=\"p-0079\" num=\"0078\">The computer readable storage medium can be a tangible device that can retain and store instructions for use by an instruction execution device.

    "\n",
    "- **Reading and spliting txt file into a list.** By using bulit-in `re.split` and `replace` function. With the helper like *re tutorial*, it was not so hard to preprocess the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extraction.** Defining function is a clear and user friendly way to parse these patent features. [regex101](https://regex101.com/) is a very useful online tool to check the regular expression. And also it can show which part is the group of regular expression. The `re.search`, `re.findall`and `re.sub` is used frequently in this part to extract the particular text from main file. Then by using basic funtion like `if else` and `loop` to make judgment and appending function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Writing text into file.** By using `pd.DateFrame` function, the dictionary can be transferred into a dateframe. And `.to_csv` function is to transfer dateframe to csv file. it is worth noting that the `index` parameter should be set False in order to avoid saving the row index into file."
